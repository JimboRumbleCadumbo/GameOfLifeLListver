[General Tools]
1. For compile, use "Shell" on the right hand side. System is Ubuntu.
2. Compile command: 
  g++ -Wall main.cpp menu.cpp [**Other_related_file**] -o main
  (*make sure you compile everytime you make changes*)
3. Execute program:
  ./main
4. Useful commands:
  ls: list all files
  mkdir [name]: make new folder
  rm [name]: remove file
  cp [name] [destination]: make a copy
  (these should be useful for now)
5. If want to try out new ideas that might change the whole outline of a program, just make a copy and compile with the new copy. Just in case if anything goes wrong.

    - Added menu.cpp & menu.h
